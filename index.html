        <p>The Informative Association for Maryland Science Advancement (NAMSA) was founded by a handful of University of Maryland students in 2017 to provide resources  for those interested in careers in the life sciences. As a part of NAMSA, this website was created to curate information about different career opportunities in order to help students in the biological sciences better understand which fields might interest them. In each tab, information is provided about different post-graduate opportunities for life science majors, including content on career paths, how to be a competitive applicant for graduate/professional school, and resources available at the University of Maryland.
