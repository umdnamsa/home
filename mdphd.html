      The MD/PhD Career Path
  </h1>

  <h2>What is an MD/PhD?</h2>
   <ul>
         <li>The MD/PhD is a dual doctoral degree for physician scientists that combines the vocational training of a Doctor of Medicine with the research rigor of a Doctor of Philosophy</li>
         <li>The MD/PhD programs are highly competitive, often taking 7-8 years to complete</li>
         <ul>
           <li>Years 1-2: First two years of Med School</li>
           <li>Years 3-6: Mostly Grad School/PhD Work</li>
           <li>Years 7-8: Last two years of Med School</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who are Biomedical Research Scientists?</h2>
     <ul>
           <li>Upon earning their dual degree, MD/PhD candidates become biomedical research scientists</li>
           <li>Biomedical research scientists are interested in researching the mechanisms that underlie disease in order to engineer patient-driven medical solutions</li>
           <ul>
             <li>Example: A neurologist who studies brain plasticity in order to develop better treatment plans for epileptic patients</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Biomedical research scientists are patient, creative, interested in biology, and persistent enough to see rigorous research projects through to conclusion</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>What are career outcomes like for Physician scientists?</h2>
       <ul>
             <li>The vast majority (~75%) become faculty at medical schools</li>
             <ul>
               <li>At medical schools, physician scientists can continue to work on their research while practicing primary care</li>
             </ul>
             <li>About 16% of physician scientists work in private medical practices</li>
             <li>Physician scientists also work at research institutes, such as HHMI and NIH</li>
             <li>Owing to their extensive education and technical skills, careers in physician science are well paid</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Much would an MD/PhD cost?</h2>
         <ul>
               <li>Since MD/PhD physician scientists are so valuable, many training programs receive extensive financial support</li>
               <li>Since NIH supports MD/PhD students with grants and stipends, most students enroll tuition free</li>
               <li >For more information on financial support for MD-PhD training, visit the American Association of Medical College’s <a href="https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/financial-support-md-phd-trainees/">web page</a> on potential funding sources for MD/PhD students:</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>How competitive are MD/PhD programs?</h2>
           <ul>
                 <li>Traditionally, MD/PhD programs receive fewer applicants than do medical schools, but they are usually more competitive</li>
                 <li>Matriculating student statistics</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Mean GPA: 3.8</li>
                   <li>Mean MCAT: 515</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The standards for admission will vary from school to school, so it is important to check with each offering program</li>
                <li>Note: It is not always necessary to have at least a 3.8 GPA in order to be admitted. It is still possible to be a competitive MD/PhD applicant with a lower GPA if you have outstanding research and clinical experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What can I do to ensure that I’ll be a competitive MD/PhD applicant?</h2>
             <ul>
                   <li>Demonstrate academic success in biology, physics, chemistry, and social science courses</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>For more information about which courses you should take as an undergrad in order to meet MD/PhD admission requirements, visit the Reed Yorke Health Professions Advising Office’s <a href="https://www.prehealth.umd.edu/coursework">web page</a> on pre-medicine coursework.</li>
