      The Veterinary Medicine Career Path
  </h1>

  <h2>What is veterinary school?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Veterinary school is a four-year program that provides students with the knowledge and experience to effectively practice veterinary medicine</li>
    <li>Graduates of veterinary school receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM)</li>
    <ul><li>The beginning years of vet school are more lecture/classroom based, while the later years involve more clinical experience and rotations</li></ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>What makes a good veterinary school student?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A good vet student shows compassion for both animals and people, and is willing to work with and for their community. They must possess strong communication skills and an understanding of the financial and emotional aspects of veterinary medicine</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What does a career in veterinary medicine look like?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals who have earned a DVM are able to pursue careers including but not limited to clinical medicine, academia, government policy, and wildlife conservation</li>
    <li>The Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) provides <a href="https://www.aavmc.org/additional-pages/veterinary-career-options.aspx">a large list</a> of potential career paths available after graduating from vet school.</li>
    <li>After graduating from vet school, students can return for an extra year to gain specialization such as specific surgeries, zoo medicine and more. A list of American Veterinary Medicine Association (AVMA) specializations can be found <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/YourVet/Pages/veterinary-specialists.aspx">here</a></li>
    <li>The national median salary of all types of veterinarians in 2018 was $88,490, but average salaries differ between different types of veterinarians</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What are the costs associated with veterinary school?</h2>
  <ul>
<li>The cost of attending vet school varies wildly from school to school, depending on if it is a public or private institution and if a student is qualified to receive in-state tuition.</li>
<li>Tuition reportedly can range anywhere from $147,000 to $250,000 for four years at public institutions. Private veterinary schools may cost more than the reported price range.</li>
<li>The American Veterinary Medical Foundations (AVMF) provides a list of scholarship opportunities for veterinary students that can be found <a href="https://www.avmf.org/programs/external-scholarship-opportunities/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How competitive is veterinary school?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, getting into vet school is considered more difficult than medical school. This is due to the comparatively low number of schools, resulting in more applicants competing for for each seat.</li>
<li>Average admitted students statistics:</li>
<ul>
<li>GPA = 3.55</li>
<li>GRE:</li>
<ul>
<li>Verbal = 66th percentile</li>
<li>Quantitative = 57th percentile</li>
<li>Analytical = 55th percentile</li>
</ul>
<li>Veterinary contact hours (either volunteer or paid) = 1600-2400 hours</li>
</ul>
<li>It is important to note that veterinary school applications revolve around several factors and it is possible to get in with lower scores! Many vet schools like to see well-rounded applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What can I do to ensure that Iâ€™ll be a competitive veterinary school applicant?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Veterinary schools do not require applicants to have a pre-vet or animal science major. As long as an applicant has completed the requisite coursework they are eligible</li>
<ul>
<li>However, majors such as animal science, biology, and zoology require many of the prerequisite courses for vet school and may provide a foundation of knowledge for aspiring veterinarians</li>
</ul>
<li>The general course guidelines for veterinary school eligiblity are as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>Required courses: English (2 semesters), Biology w/ lab (2 semesters), General Chemistry w/ Lab (2 semesters). Organic Chemistry (2 semesters), Physics w/ Lab (2 semesters, Calculus (1 semester), Biochemistry (1 semester), Humanities/Social Science (2-4 semesters)</li>
<li>Recommended courses: Genetics (1 semester), Microbiology w/ Lab(1 semester), Physiology (1 semester)</li>
<li>It is important to note that different vet schools will have different prerequisite courses and it is important to look into the specifics at each school you consider applying to. The AAVMC updates a comprehensive list of required courses at vet schools across the country can be found <a href="https://www.aavmc.org/data/files/vmcas/prereqchrt14.pdf">here</a></li>
<li>Undergraduate courses recommended by the University of Maryland for pre-vet students are listed <a href="https://agnr.umd.edu/information-prospective-pre-vet-students">here</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Veterinary schools weigh previous veterinary experiences very highly. This includes any experience working with animals, such as with livestock, volunteering at a zoo or animal shelter, or shadowing.</li>
<ul>
<li>Often, competitive applicants have at least two different types of veterinarian experiences, with substantial depth of experience in at least one area </li>
<li>The University of Maryland has a <a href="http://umd.orgsync.com/org/prevetumd/home">Pre-Veterinary Society</a> that provides student support, information, and opportunities to pre-vet students</li>
<li>Veterinary schools also encourage research experience that revolves around animals, however it is not a requirement of vet school applicants</li>
</ul>
<li>Community service and leadership positions help to round out the applications of competitive applicants, as veterinary schools like to admit students who exhibit a commitment to their community and an ability to lead</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<li>All veterinary schools require a personal statement in which applicant discuss their personal background, interests, experiences that have led them to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.
