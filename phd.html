      Graduate School
  </h1>


  <h2>What is graduate school?</h2><ul>
  <li>Graduate school provides students with the opportunity to further their education in a specific topic of their interest and become professionals in their desired field of study</li>
  <li>Graduate programs offer two different types of degrees that take different amounts of times to complete based on the field of study:</li>
  <ul><li>Master’s Degree = 1-2 years to complete</li>
  <li>Doctoral Degree (PhD) = 3-7 years to compete </li></ul>
  <li>In graduate school, students both take classes and work in a research lab for the first few years before transferring full-time into lab for the end of their degree</li>
  <li>Most graduate students are required to complete research or teach a course as part of their experience while working toward earning their degree</li>
</ul>

  <h2>What makes a good graduate school student?</h2>
  <ul><li>Strong graduate students are motivated and persistent in their desire to learn. They have passion for their field of interest with a good work ethic that drives them to explore the unknown
  </li></ul>

  <h2>What might a post-graduate school career look like?</h2><ul>
  <li>Earning either a Master’s degree or a PhD opens the door to careers in research, academia, and the private sector</li>
  <li>Attending graduate schools in the sciences provides a level of experience and understanding in a topic that leads to an expertise in the area of interest that benefits job searches</li>
  <li>The average salary of graduate students after obtaining their degree varies drastically based on the field of study and type of degree. Yearly salary estimates can be researched <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(PhD)/Salary">here</a></li>
</ul>

  <h2>What are the costs associated with graduate school?</h2><ul>
  <li>The cost of graduate school depends on the school, degree being sought, and the field of study</li>
  <ul><li>Average cost of a Master’s Degree is between $30,000 and $120,000, but this varies based on the type of Master’s Degree</li>
  <ul><li>Ex - The average cost of an MBA is $40,000</li></ul>
  <li>The cost of obtaining a PhD is dependent on the field of study, and many graduate programs in the sciences provide funding that pays the graduate student to conduct research as they pursue their degree</li>
</ul><li>There are many programs and grants that exist that provide funding for graduate students in science fields, many of which can be found in <a href="https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/grad.aspx">this database</a></li>
  <li>Graduate schools themselves might also award grants or funding to graduate students when they apply to their program</li>
</ul>

  <h2>How competitive are graduate school programs?</h2><ul>
  <li>While the top graduate programs are highly competitive, there are many graduate schools across the country. This contributes to the generally consideration of graduate schools less difficult to get into than medical school.</li>
  <li>Matriculating student statistics</li><ul>
  <li>GPA - average GPA of students accepted to graduate schools vary depending on program, but GPAs 3.5 and above are generally considered competitive</li>
  <ul><li>The GPA of classes related to the field of study of students is also considered by graduate school admissions</li>
  </ul><li>GRE - average GRE scores also are highly variable between programs, but a good GRE score could be considered between a 310-315 combined between the math and verbal sections</li>
</ul><li>It is important to note that graduate schools look at applications holistically, and applicants can gain acceptance with lower scores based on other factors!</li>
</ul>

  <h2>What can I do to ensure that I’ll be a competitive graduate school applicant?</h2><ul>
  <li>Graduate schools look for students who show a passion for the field of study they intend to pursue. This means relevant majors and other related electives show dedication to a subject and can be beneficial in the application process</li>
  <li>Study for and score competitively (aim for a 310-315)</li><ul>
  <li>Not all schools require the GRE, but many still do</li>
  <li>The GRE costs $205</li>
  <li>A UMD information sheet regarding the GRE can be found <a href="https://bsosundergrad.umd.edu/sites/bsosundergrad.umd.edu/files/GRE%20Fast%20FAQs%2018-19.pdf">here</a></li>
  <li>To show greater mastery of a topic, applicants can complete GRE subject tests ($150)</li>
  <li>GRE scores are valid for five years after taking the test</li></ul>
  <li>Graduate schools encourage applicants to have research experience before applying, to ensure that their students are familiar with and passionate about conducting research. This means to be a competitive applicant, you should seek out a meaningful research position or internship</li>
  <ul><li>While it is beneficial to have published research, it is not required and unpublished research experience, such as defending a thesis is useful</li>
  <li>At UMD, the CMNS website has multiple research and internship opportunity databases that can be explored <a href="https://cmns.umd.edu/undergraduate/research-internships">here</a> and <a href="https://bsci.umd.edu/research-internships">here</a></li>
  <li>It is also beneficial for research experience to be in your field of interest, although it is not required</li>
</ul><li>Craft and revise a personal statement that reiterates your desire to conduct research in your field of interest</li>
  <ul><li>Berkeley provides a great <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Grad/GradStatement">walkthrough, FAQs, and tipsheet</a> that gives advice about writing personal statements for graduate school</li>
  </ul><li>The standard number of letters of recommendation for graduates schools is three, but applicants are welcome to submit more</li>
  <ul><li>One letter should be from a science professor, and another letter should be from a researcher with whom you have worked</li>
  </ul><li>Advice about whom to ask letters of recommendations is provided by the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Grad/GradLetter">Berkeley career center</a></li>
</ul>
