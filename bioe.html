      Career Paths in Bioengineering
  </h1>

  <h2>What is Bioengineering?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Bioengineering involves the application of engineering to solve problems in biological contexts</li>
  <li>Bioengineers look to engineer devices capable of mimicking biological equivalents</li>
  <ul><li>Ex: tissue engineering and development of artificial heart valves and stents</li></ul>
  <li>Bioengineers develop and improve biomedical technology</li>
  <ul><li>Ex: researching advanced medical imaging technology</li></ul>
  <li>Unlike mechanical and civil engineering, bioengineering is more of a research-oriented engineering field</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Should I get an advanced degree in bioengineering?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Owing largely to the rigor associated with an undergraduate degree in bioengineering, it is not always necessary for bioengineers to attain advanced degrees</li>
  <ul><li>B.S. in bioengineering offers career paths in medicine, biomechanics, biofluidics, tissue engineering, and <a href="https://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/engineering/bioengineering-major.htm">more</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>M.S. in Bioengineering</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Masters programs are completed in two years and usually offer very specific focus areas</li>
  <li>Ex: Biomedical computation</li>
  <li>Masters programs allow bioengineers to specialize their knowledge and develop advanced technical skills</li>
  <li>In some cases, M.S. candidates will complete a research thesis</li>
</ul>
  <li>PhD in bioengineering</li>
  <ul>
  <li>PhD programs are completed in about five years and are research-oriented</li>
  <li>PhD candidates will research alongside a faculty advisors to develop and work on a rigorous thesis</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Can I get a graduate degree in bioengineering if I do not have an undergraduate degree in bioengineering?</h2>
<ul>
<li>While an undergraduate degree in bioengineering would be the best preparation for M.S./PhD work, it is still possible to attain an advanced degree in bioengineering if you have an undergraduate degree in a related field (biology, biochemistry, physics)</li>
<li>Biology/biochemistry majors should demonstrate a strong background in mathematics and physics</li>
<ul><li>Take Calculus I,II,III and Differential Equations</li></ul>
<li>Physics majors should demonstrate a strong background in the biological sciences</li>
<ul>
<li>Take fundamental biology courses</li>
<li>Perform research in a field of biological application, such as biophysics</li></ul>
<li>For more information on which courses rising bioengineering students are expected to have completed, visit the <a href="https://bioe.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">Fischell Department of Bioengineering’s web page on graduate school admissions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are career outcomes like for bioengineers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Career opportunities in bioengineering are expected to grow over the next decade</li>
<ul>
<li>Advances in 3-D printing technology could bring new possibilities for progress in biomedicine</li>
</ul>
<li>Most bioengineers work in medical device development and supplies manufacturing</li>
<ul>
<li>Ex: tissue engineering</li>
</ul>
<li>Many bioengineers work in research settings, either at universities or research institutes such as NIH/HHMI</li>
<li>Many bioengineers work in hospitals as biomedical research scientists</li>
<li>Owing to their problem-solving and technical skills, bioengineers are well paid</li>
<ul>
<li>Mid-career, bioengineers make ~$95,000 per year</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>How much will an advanced degree in bioengineering cost?</h2>
<ul>
<li>M.S. in bioengineering</li>
<ul>
<li>$60-70,000 per year</li>
<li>For more information on financing your graduate school education, visit the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/graduate-professional-funding-info.pdf">U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid program website</a>.</li>
</ul><li>PhD in bioengineering</li><ul>
<li>PhDs in bioengineering are usually tuition free and covered by grants/stipends from NSF/NIH</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>How competitive is engineering school admission?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Admission to graduate level engineering programs is highly competitive</li>
<li>Many programs will seek GPA > 3.2 or even GPA > 3.5</li>
<li>Graduate engineering schools seek applicants with a strong background in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics</li>
<li>Most applicants have internship and engineering project experience</li>
<li>Since bioengineering is research oriented, many applicants have rigorous previous research experience </li>
</ul>

<h2>What can I do to be a competitive engineering school applicant?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate academic success in biology, physics, chemistry, and mathematics courses</li>
<ul><li>For more information about which courses you should take as an undergrad in order to meet engineering school admission requirements, visit the <a href="https://bioe.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">Fischell Department of Bioengineering’s web page</a> on graduate school admissions.</li>
</ul><li>Score competitively on the GRE (90-95th percentile)</li><ul>
<li>Costs about $205</li>
<li>More information about the Educational Testing Service’s <a href="https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/applying-medical-school-process/fee-assistance-program/">Fee Assistance Program</a>.</li></ul>
<li>Demonstrate a passionate commitment to research</li><ul>
<li>Multiple summer projects</li>
<li>Consider a senior thesis project</li></ul>
<li>Look for internship/engineering project experience</li><ul>
