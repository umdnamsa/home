  <h2>What is dental school?</h2>
   <ul>
         <li>Dental school is a professional program that provides the necessary training and courses for students to become practicing dentists. </li>
         <li>Dental school is generally a four year program through which students obtain either a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DDM) which allow an individual to become a General Dentist. </li>
         <ul>
           <li>The first two years of dental school are more lecture-based, while the later two-years are more clinic-based</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>What makes a good dental school student?</h2>
     <ul>
           <li>Dental school students are encouraged to have an interest in public health, science, art, and athstetics. Dental students are often academically-inclined and exhibit good time management. Dental schools look for students who are committed to public health, aware of social problems, and exhibit leadership and compassion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does a career in dentistry look like?</h2>
       <ul>
             <li>The majority of  dental school graduates go on to become a general practitioners and start their own practice, while others enter fields of public/international health, academia, or research.</li>
             <li>The American Dental Association (ADA) provides <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/be-a-dentist/dentistry-career-options">a list of different careers</a> available to graduates of dental school </li>
             <li>There are ten types of dental specializations that open different specialized opportunities. These can be found on the ADA’s website <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/ncrdscb/dental-specialties/specialty-definitions">here</a></li>
             <li>In 2018 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the  median income for a dental school graduate to be $153,900.</li>
             <ul>
               <li>The entry level median income was reported to be $118,800</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are the costs associated with dental school?</h2>
         <ul>
               <li>Tuition varies between schools, however the average private dental school costs $67,399 per year, and $265,596 over the course of four-years.</li>
               <ul><li>In-state tuition at public institutions is often significantly cheaper</li></ul>
               <li>Scholarships for dental school students, as well as loan and repayment information can be found on the American Student Dental Association (ASDA) website <a href="https://www.asdanet.org/index/dental-student-resources/scholarships-and-repayment-plans/scholarships">here</a>.</li>

          </ul>


          <h2>How competitive is dental school?</h2>
           <ul>
                 <li>Typically, dental school receives fewer total applicants than medical school, but receive more applications per available seat.</li>
                 <li>Average matriculating student statistics:</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>GPA = 3.6</li>
                   <li>Science GPA = 3.5</li>
                   <li>DAT = 19</li>
                </ul>
                <li>It is important to note that dental school applications revolve around several factors and it is possible to get in with lower scores!</li>
                <li>Average scores also vary between schools. The average GPA and DAT scores of matriculating students at different dental schools can be found <a href="http://www.dat-prep.com/dat-scores-for-dental-schools">here</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What can I do to ensure that I’ll be a competitive dental school applicant?</h2>
             <ul>
                   <li>Many students think that dental schools require science-focused undergraduate majors, but in actuality any dental schools accept students from any major if they have completed the required courses.</li>
                   <li>The general course guidelines are as follows:</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>Required Courses (Full year): Biology w/ Lab, Physics w/ Lab, Inorganic Chemistry w/ Lab, Organic Chemistry w/ Lab, Writing-Based English</li>
                     <li>Suggested Courses (Sometimes required, One semester) : Biochemistry, Anatomy, Mathematics, Psychology</li>
                     <li>Advantageous Courses: Business, Foreign Language, Humanities/Social Sciences</li>
                     <li>It is important to be aware that the prerequisite courses can vary between schools and you should research the course requirements at each school you consider applying to</li>
                   </ul>
                   <li>The list of courses for pre-dental students at UMD can be found on the pre-health advising office’s website <a href="https://www.prehealth.umd.edu/pre-dental-coursework">here</a></li>
                   <li>Beyond scores, dental schools like to see a well rounded background that includes:</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>Clinical experience - generally related to dental professions, including but not limited to shadowing, volunteering at clinics, and/or working as a DA or RDA (requires proper licensing)</li>
                     <li>Community service - dental schools like to see that their students are community-oriented, and extra weight is given to oral health-oriented community outreach or service</li>
                     <li>Research experience - while research experience is encouraged, it is not required. Research can be completed in any field, not just biomedical science, as dental schools consider the scientific process to be relatively uniform across disciplines</li>
                     <li>Leadership - dental schools know that dentists serve their community, and thus they look for applicants with leadership experience that suggests they will be good dentists</li>
                   </ul>
              </ul>

                     <ul>
                       <li>The DAT is used to judge a prospective student’s general knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts</li>
                       <li>The exam has four sections: Sciences, Perceptual Ability, Reading Comprehension and Quantitative Reasoning</li>
                       <li>The exam costs $445 and is 4:15 long. It is offered year-round, but can only be taken three times total (with 90 days minimum between attempts)</li>

                    <li>There are approximately 60 dental schools  in the United States, and applicants should do research to determine which is best schools are the best fit for them.

                    <li>To apply to dental school an applicant must submit the general application ($225 total) which can be found <a href="https://www.adea.org/GoDental/The_application_to_dental_school__ADEA_AADSAS.aspx">here</a>.

                    <li>The common dental school application requires letters of recommendation. Most dental schools ask for four (sometimes three) letters of recommendations: two from science professors, one from an advisor, and one from a practicing dentist</li>
